# The purpose of this workflow is to update the master coverage metric for the
# repo. We can only do this when merging to master.

# We are assuming here that PR coverage has been computed and uploaded as an
# artifact during a PR workflow. If it does not exist, we will fail this
# workflow and not update the master coverage.
