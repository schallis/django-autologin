name: On PR Merge Update Coverage

# The purpose of this workflow is to update the master coverage metric for the
# repo. We can only do this when merging to master.

# We are assuming here that PR coverage has been computed, deemed acceptable,
# and uploaded as an artifact during a PR workflow. If it does not exist, we
# will fail this workflow and not update the master coverage.

# We are NOT guaranteed to have a master coverage at this point. This could be
# the first PR (or first since the master coverage artifact expired).
